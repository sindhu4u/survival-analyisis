    **Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally.** 
    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 17.9 million people died 
    from CVDs in 2019, representing 32% of all global deaths. 
    CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, 
    including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease, 
    and other conditions.

This innovative tool empowers physicians with an efficient way to predict heart failure survival. By focusing on two vital clinical indicatorsâ€”**serum creatinine** and **ejection fraction**â€”this tool provides valuable insights that enhance decision-making and patient care. Embracing this kind of technology represents a significant leap toward personalized medicine, paving the way for improved health outcomes and more accurate predictions. With these kinds of tools, we're not just advancing medical technologyâ€”we're transforming the future of patient care for the better.
